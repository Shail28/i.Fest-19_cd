			<h1>About Us</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="detai">
			<p>i.Fest is one of the most anticipated and acknowledged technical fest all over Gujarat. It is 
				lauded for its versatile and wide ranging technical,social, non-technical events. i.Fest provides 
				students an outstanding platform for students to showcase, inculcate the valuable skill of 
				innovation and simultaneously compete with their technical and non-technical skills and win 
				huge amount of cash prizes. Last year, we witnessed over 2000 participants in this 3-day 
				techno-social events.

			<h1>#Evanescent Qualm</h1>

			<p>As the theme is quite perplexing and not comprehensible on 
				first look, but donâ€™t judge too fast, here is a latent 
				meaning to it. Evanescent means fading or disappearing 
				and qualm means uncertainty. Together it means disappearing 
				of uncertainty. In such tremendously technologically advancing 
				world, where everything is outdated every moment, we can 
				predict the future. YES, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT!!! We can fathom 
				where we are heading to. What we think is impossible right 
				now, this thought, will disappear and anything you are uncertain 
				about will come true in seconds or may be picoseconds. 
				Our fest is all about discarding or fading of thoughts 
				about implausibility and make qualms certain.</p>
